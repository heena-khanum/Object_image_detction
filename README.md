# object_image_detection
🧠 Object & Face Recognition System 🔍
Welcome to the ultimate AI-powered Image Recognition system — it not only detects what's in the image but remembers your face like a true stalker with good intentions 😄🕵️‍♂️

📸 Sample Input Image
This is what the system sees 👇

<img src="images/input_sample.jpg" width="400"/>
🧑‍💻 Recognized Person Output
And here's what it guesses... with 98% confidence 😎

<img src="images/output_detected.jpg" width="400"/>
✔️ Recognized as: Heena Khanum
🎯 Accuracy: 98.47%

🧾 Features
🚀 Real-time face recognition using OpenCV

📂 Trained on custom images of specific people

🧠 Uses Haar Cascade / CNN (mention which)

😄 Outputs name, accuracy, and even saves results

💾 Can be used as a lightweight security bot

😂 One-liner Joke (Because AI shouldn’t be boring)
“Why did the AI break up with the image?
Because it lost interest after one scan! 🤖❤️📷”

🔧 How to Run

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
Make sure you have your camera connected 🎥

👨‍👩‍👧 Add Your Own Faces
Just drop some clear face images into the imagesbasic/ folder, name them correctly, retrain (if needed), and you're good to go!
You can even prank your friends by making the bot say funny things when it detects them 😂
